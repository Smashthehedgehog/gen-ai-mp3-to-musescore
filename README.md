# gen-ai-mp3-to-musescore
A generative AI project where I convert mp3 files into sheet music. At the moment, this is just the workspace for the general project. I am trying to use a combination of
Demucs and the MT3 model to split and transcribe the music, but I am seeing unfavorable results at the moment. Thus, for version 1, I will just use the MT3 model to directly
transcribe the entire intial instead of splitting it up first.
